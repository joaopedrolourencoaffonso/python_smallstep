# Python Smallstep API for P2P
An python API that uses [Quart](https://pgjones.gitlab.io/quart/index.html), [Telethon](https://telethonn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Step ca](https://smallstep.com/)  to provide a simple Registration Authority for P2P.

## Latest update
### further security, logs and revoke

New [version 9](https://github.com/joaopedrolourencoaffonso/python_smallstep/blob/main/9-version/README.md) on the air!

This new version brings:
- Full revoke client
- Revoke token API
- Log for data analysis
- Anti spam measures

## Next steps
Currently, my objectives include:

- Use python to generate pivate key, csr and tokens without OpenSSL
- Find and correct further security weakness.
