what it does: It provides a way of the client to get a signed certificate from step-ca using Telegram as identity provisioner.
Basically, it sends a request to registration.py using SSL, provokig registration.py to send an random token to the informed
number through Telegram. Once and if the person informs the correct token, registration.py provides an jwt to the client that
then uses it to interact directly with the step-ca through it's API.

            This sleep is due to the fact that the popen runs in a *subprocess*, that is, in parallel.
            This means that if there is no action between one popen and another, there is a chance that the second popen will activate before the
            first bit ends, like it did in version 3. I don't like many of these sleeps, but at the moment
            they keep things running, plus the jwt lasts 5 min, so we're in the safe zone.

            the false above was due to the fact that CA is homegrown, if you make

            It has been already fixed.
