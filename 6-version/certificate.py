what it does: It send and http request to the registration.py API, the registration.py send's an temp token through Telegram. 
The user then must type the token on the command line. With that done, the script get's the token, generates an private key and
sends the corresponding csr to the step ca.

            This sleep is due to the fact that the popen runs in a *subprocess*, that is, in parallel.
            This means that if there is no action between one popen and another, there is a chance that the second popen will activate before the
            first bit ends, like it did in version 3. I don't like many of these sleeps, but at the moment
            they keep things running, plus the jwt lasts 5 min, so we're in the safe zone.

            IMPORTANT: the 'common name' of the certificate must always be the same provided in the ```step ca token``` command.
            In other worlds, if you provide: "5502199999999" as the name in the name when generating the csr, this must also be the name in the step comand

            the false above is due to the fact that CA is homegrown, if you make
